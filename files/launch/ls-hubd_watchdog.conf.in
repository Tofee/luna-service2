description "watchdog to reboot if ls-hubd_private or ls-hubd_public dies"

start on stopping ls-hubd_private or stopping ls-hubd_public

# This job is started when either ls-hubd_public or ls-hubd_private
# enter the 'stopping' state.  If this is part of a normal exit
# (manual shutdown or reboot) 
#    RESULT will be "ok"
#     - or -
#   RUNLEVEL will be 0 or 1 (shutdown) or 6 (reboot)
# both are testing since I did not always see the RESULT value set
# since we only act in the 'else' case, the tests are negated
# and anded.
